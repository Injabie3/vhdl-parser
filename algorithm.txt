findAndSetTokenDetails
	 - Examine stringRep in the token, and make everything in the string lowercase via a local copy
	 - If the token is a keyword, trip _isKeyword bool.
		- Find first of ,<>=:\"'.:+-/*&|;#()0123456789 (aka delimiters and alphanumerals), and don't continue checking for keyword if -1 is not produced.
		- Run through a loop to compare with an array that has the keywords all in lowercase.
	 - Categorize token into one of the following:
		- comment bodies
			- Make sure previous token exists.
			- check previous token to see if it contains "--"
			- check if the current token is not a \n or \r
			- If both statements above are true, then token is a comment body
		- operators
			- Compare local stringRep of token to operators array to see if there is a match.
				- If matched, then categorize as operator.
		- literals
			- check for two instances of '' or "", or if token contains numerals only, or true false.
			- If true, then categorize as literal.
			- If first character is ', then type is std_logic. No width
			- If first character is ", then type is std_logic_vector. Width = difference between " positions
			- if first character is numeral, then type is integer. No width
			- Check if first character is box - then type is std_logic_vector
				- Find length between ""
				- multiply that length accordingly depending on binary/octal/hex and that is width
		- identifiers
			- Check if first character is a letter.
			- check to see that there are no illegal ID characters (eg. delimiters)
			- If above is all okay, categorize as identifier.
			- Check previous token for "signal" or "variable" or if sigVarDeclaration is true.
				- If true, then find the token after the : token, and set sigVarDeclaration to true.
				- Take that token as the type.
				- Check the token after the type.
					<type> ( # downto/to # )
					- If that token is (, take next token # and convert to int, and store as "starting value"
					- skip downto/to token, and take next token # and convert to int, and store as "end value"
					- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194465/how-to-parse-a-string-to-an-int-in-c for into on string to int conversion
					- take the difference of the absolute value of the two, and add 1 to it.
					- This is the width of the token. Store accordingly
				- Check previous tokens to see if there is identifier with same name, and set it's tokenDetails if so.
			- Check previous token for "constant" or if constDeclaration is true.
				- If true, then find the token after the : token, and set constDeclaration to true.
				- Take that token as the type.
				- Check the token after the type.
					<type> ( # downto/to # )
					- If that token is (, take next token # and convert to int, and store as "starting value"
					- skip downto/to token, and take next token # and convert to int, and store as "end value"
					- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194465/how-to-parse-a-string-to-an-int-in-c for into on string to int conversion
					- take the difference of the absolute value of the two, and add 1 to it.
					- This is the width of the token. Store accordingly
				- Check all tokens in list to see if there is identifier with same name
					- If true, set it's tokenDetails, and replace its stringRep.
			- If above is not satisfied, check all previous tokens to see if there is another identifier with same name, and copy its contents if needed.
		- others
			- If token is : and sigVarDeclaration is true, set sigVarDeclaration to false.
			- last case, take care of everything else.
			
findAllConditionalExpressions
	- While the pointer to the current token is not NULL:
		- If "if", "elsif", "else", or "when" is found, toggle conditional flag.
		- Else if "end" is found, check next token to see if it's an "if" and handle accordingly.
		- Else if conditional flag is true, make a copy of the token, and append to new TokenList.
		- Go to next token
	- Return pointer to new TokenList.


checkErrorConditionalExpressions
	- Point pointer to front of entire token list
	- While the pointer to the current token is not NULL:
		- If "if" is found, and CS has not begun, set CS flag to true,
		- Else if "if" is found, and CS has begun, and there is no previous "then", increment missingEndIf and missingThen.
			- If verbose is true, output the line with the error type (missing end if and then).
		- Else if "if" is found, and CS has begun, and there is previous "then", increment missingEndIf, and set foundThen to false.
			- If verbose is true, output the line with the error type (missing then).
		- Else if "then" is found and CS is true, set foundThen flag to true.
		- Else if "elsif" is found, and foundThen flag is true, set foundThen flag to false.
		- Else if "elsif" is found, and foundThen flag is false, increment missingThen.
			- If verbose is true, output the line with the error type (missing then).
		- If "end" is found, check next token.
			- If next token is "if":
				- Set CS to false.
				- If foundThen is false, increment missingThen, and if verbose, output error.
		- If the next token is NULL, break out of loop.
		- Go to next token.
	- If CS flag is still set at the end, and foundThen is false
		- Increment missingThen and missingEndIf
		- If verbose is true, output the line with the error type (missing then and end if)
	- If CS flag is still set
		- Increment missingEndIf
		- If verbose is true, output the line with the error type (missing end if) 
			
checkConditionalMismatch
	- Point to the front of the conditional list using temp pointer
	- Loop through token list to find conditional operator
		- Have a pointer point to previous and next token.
		- Compare the two tokens.
			- If either one is missing tokenDetails, output error if verbose(Unknown type and width) and keep count.
			- If they don't have matching types, output error if verbose (Type mismatch) and keep count.
			- If they don't have matching widths, output error if verbose (Width mismatch) and keep count.
		- Loop and keep checking.
